# Learning Git and Github

I am following this tutorial series by
[Goran Kortjie](https://dev.to/ifierygod/git-and-github-the-complete-guides-chapter1-23cp)
on dev.to community. It is a very good and complete tutorial on the essentials of
[Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Github](https://github.com).

If you want more details about the commands and the content on this notes go to the
official series on dev community and support Goran.

Along the way I . I will let the links here
as well.

While I was following the tutorial i faced some local challenges with git and end
up learning some other commands, reading other articles and tutorials, aside the
specific git series that i mentioned earlier. So, i want to add them here too and
expend even more this notes.


git version used while writing this notes:
```
git version 2.25.1
```
